Mr.K (Kranker) goes to the store on the weekend. He is looking for new shirts to buy. Mr.K does not like sarcasm and is a very straightfoward man.
 He buys 10 t-shirts that says peace and love on them. Then he wears them for the rest of the week to teach his social studies class.
Mr. K hates computers. He also likes to share his passwords with his friends. One day, Mr. K gets a very big scary virus on his computer.
